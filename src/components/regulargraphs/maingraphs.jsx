					This graph shows the correlation between anti-Asian hate
					crimes and COVID-19 infection rates in California between
					January 2019 to September 2020. The vertical red line
					intersecting March 2020 indicated when the lockdown mandates
					began taking place around the United States. In March 2020,
					infection rates significantly increased and by the end of
					the month over 8000 people were infected. At the time,
					people began to panic and buy extra groceries, fight over
					hand sanitizer, and, most unfortunately, pin the blame of
					the virus on Asians. As seen in California, hate crime
					reports shot up from 4 to 17 once COVID cases began to rise.
					That is an absurd increase of 325% in 1 month! Over time as
					cases grew, however, the line of hate crimes is seen
					decreasing. There are multiple potential factors that we
					considered to interpret this data: Not all hate crimes are
					reported to the police due to limited English proficiency
					and the inability to report a hate crime in their primary
					language or a distrust of the police. Therefore, the real
					numbers may not be reflected in our data. As the lockdown
					progressed over time, less people were outside and less hate
					crimes were reported as a result.
